            Despite dealing with the serious issues of rape and racial inequality,
            
            
            
            the novel is renowned for its warmth and humor. Atticus Finch, 
            the narrator's father, has served as a moral hero for many readers 
            and as a model of integrity for lawyers. The historian Joseph Crespino
             explains, "In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably 
             the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its main character, 
             Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism."[1] As a Southern
              Gothic novel and Bildungsroman, the primary themes of To Kill a Mockingbird involve racial
               injustice and the destruction of innocence. Scholars have noted that Lee also addresses
                issues of class, courage, compassion, and gender roles in the Deep South. The book is
                 widely taught in schools in the United States with lessons that emphasize tolerance and
                  decry prejudice.[2] Despite its themes, To Kill a Mockingbird has been subject to campaigns
                   for removal from public classrooms, often challenged for its use of racial epithets. In 2006, British librarians ranked the book ahead of the Bible as one "every adult should read before they die".[3]
